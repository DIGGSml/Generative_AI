# Generative_AI

A collaborative repository for developing, sharing, and experimenting with system prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) for DIGGS understanding and conversions.

## About this Repository

This repository serves as a hub for the DIGGS community to collectively explore and enhance our understanding of generative AI systems. Through shared resources, experimentation, and documentation, we aim to build a comprehensive knowledge base around effective prompt engineering and LLM utilization.

## Why This Matters

### System Prompt Sharing

System prompts are the hidden architects of LLM behavior. By openly sharing, documenting, and iterating on system prompts, we can:

- Develop more consistent, reliable, and useful AI assistants
- Identify patterns that lead to improved responses
- Create specialized prompts for different use cases and domains
- Enable reproducible results across different implementations

### Model Selection Guide

Not all LLMs are created equal. This repository aims to document:

- Comparative strengths and weaknesses of different models
- Specialized capabilities unique to specific models
- Performance benchmarks across various tasks
- Cost-benefit analysis for different deployment scenarios

### Tool Use in LLMs

Modern LLMs can extend their capabilities through tool use. We're documenting:

- Effective patterns for tool integration
- Implementation strategies across different frameworks
- Best practices for designing tool interfaces
- Examples of complex workflows combining multiple tools

### Open Source Alternatives

While commercial models dominate headlines, the open source ecosystem is rapidly evolving. We track:

- High-performing open source alternatives to commercial models
- Self-hosting options and requirements
- Fine-tuning approaches for specialized use cases
- Community developments and emerging models
